# Resources for micromouse/STM32/libopencm3 programming

- RM0394: General reference manual for STM32L4 microcontrollers (big document,
  lots of useful information about bare-metal programming of the
  microcontroller):
  <https://www.st.com/resource/en/reference_manual/dm00151940-stm32l41xxx-42xxx-43xxx-44xxx-45xxx-46xxx-advanced-arm-based-32-bit-mcus-stmicroelectronics.pdf>
- Other datasheets:
    - STM32L432KC (our specific microcontroller chip) (probably not a whole lot
      of relevant information for programming):
      <https://www.st.com/resource/en/datasheet/stm32l432kc.pdf>
    - STM32 nucleo boards (also not a ton of relevant information for
      programming but it has info about the development board itself as well as
      a schematic of the development board):
      <https://www.st.com/resource/en/user_manual/dm00231744-stm32-nucleo-32-boards-mb1180-stmicroelectronics.pdf>
- libopencm3 documentation!:
  <http://libopencm3.org/docs/latest/stm32l4/html/index.html>


TODO: add the GPIO connection table as well as stuff like the micromouse board
schematics.
